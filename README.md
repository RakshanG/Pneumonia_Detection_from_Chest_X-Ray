# ðŸ©» Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays (ResNet50)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet50) to classify chest X-ray images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.  
The model is trained on the [Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
